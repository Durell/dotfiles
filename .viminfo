	<p>Consumers submitting an application for a loan at cashadvancepaydayloansonline.com incur no cost. cashadvancepaydayloansonline.com
	    does not provide lending services directly to consumers. Based on the application
	    consumers submit, cashadvancepaydayloansonline.com searches its database housing its vast network
	    of reliable lenders to pair consumers with the lender and loan ideally suited to
	    their needs.</p>
	<p>All fees and rate information will be disclosed to consumers by their lender at the
	    time of approval. Upon conclusion of the search and application approval, you will
	    be redirected to an e-signature page provided to you by the lender to which you
	    were matched. This document will contain all fees and rate information pertaining
	    to the loan being offered by a lender from the cashadvancepaydayloansonline.com network. Consumers
	    are required to review the fee and rate information provided by their lender at
	    this time thoroughly and completely before agreeing to the terms of the loan. Consumers
	    are under no obligation to accept these terms.</p>
	<p>If the consumer decides the loan terms detailed in the lender contract are acceptable
	    and wishes to proceed with the loan process, consumer may append an e-signature
	    to the page. Once the consumer enters into a legally binding contract with the lender,
	    consumer assumes all costs and risks associated with the contract. At that point,
	    the consumer is obligated solely to the lender and is never at any point obligated
	    to cashadvancepaydayloansonline.com. The loan fees and interest rates are determined solely by the
	    lender to which the consumer is matched, with specific amounts determined based
	    upon the application information submitted. cashadvancepaydayloansonline.com has no bearing on the
	    determination of these fee amounts and interest rates.</p>
	<p>Cash advances are intended for short-term financial relief and do not constitute
	    long-term financial solutions. Consumers facing debt and credit difficulties should
	    seek out debt and credit advisory help. Consumers are encouraged to consult our
	    Rates and Fees page to learn more about the risks involved with cash advances, local
	    laws and regulations governing cash advances, possible loan alternatives and recent
	    developments in their state.</p>
	<p>The states this website services may change from time to time and without notice.
	    All aspects and transactions on this site will be deemed to have taken place in
	    the state of California, regardless of where you may be accessing this site. cashadvancepaydayloansonline.com
	    does not guarantee that completing an application form will result in you being
	    matched with a service provider or lender, being offered a loan product with satisfactory
	    rates or terms, nor receiving a loan from a service provider or lender. cashadvancepaydayloansonline.com
	    specifically does not offer or solicit cash advances in Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia,
	    Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, or Ohio. You will

	<p>Service providers or lenders will not require credit scores with the three major
	    credit reporting bureaus: Experian, Equifax, or Trans Union. However, credit checks
	    or consumer reports through alternative providers such as Teletrack or DP Bureau,
	    which typically will not affect your credit score, may be obtained by some service
